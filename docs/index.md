# Cows

_Free verse by Anon_

Brutish beasts, however hard they try,
Will always be fed.
Brute, blond, brutish beasts.
Do brutish beasts make you shiver?
do they?

Big bulls, however hard they try,
Will always be infected.
Big bulls are dirty. big bulls are putrid,
big bulls are purulent, however.

How happy are wooly, black bovines!
Now hirsute is just the thing,
To get me wondering if black bovines are flocculent.
