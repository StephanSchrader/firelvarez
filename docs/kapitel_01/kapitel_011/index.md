# 1.1 Henrhowla Uberhenry

_Free verse by Anon_

## 1.1.1

Brutish beasts, however hard they try,
Will always be fed.
Brute, blond, brutish beasts.
Do brutish beasts make you shiver?
do they?

## 1.1.2

Big bulls, however hard they try,
Will always be infected.
Big bulls are dirty. big bulls are putrid,
big bulls are purulent, however.

## 1.1.3

How happy are wooly, black bovines!
Now hirsute is just the thing,
To get me wondering if black bovines are flocculent.
